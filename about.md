## Grading

Your grade will be based on three components: **Paper Reading 10%; Paper Presentation + Review 30%; Class Participation 20%; Final Project 40% (5% proposal + 10% progress report + 15% final report + 10% presentation)**. There will be no homeworks or exams.

### Class Format

This class will combine lectures and discussions. The lectures will typically cover the core groundwork. The discussions will follow the role-playing style led in-depth discussion based on assigned readings. Readings and lecture materials will be posted on the schedule.

Paper readings will be posted a week prior to the lecture. You will be able to access them from the schedule. You are required to submit a short summary of the readings prior to the lecture. This will count towards your paper reading grade. Additionally, a sign-up sheet will be provided to sign up for the additional roles If you They will be due on the Friday the week after they have been released. Grades will be made available within 10 days of the deadline. Your homeworks will be submitted via Gradescope. Coding will be in Python. Written homeworks should be submitted in Latex. A template will be made available with the homework. Each student will have **144 cumulative hours (6 days)** of late time (as measured on Canvas), which will be forgiven. After this cumulative amount of time has passed, any assignment that is turned in late will receive zero credit. Furthermore, only up to 48 hours (2 days) of late time may be used on any one assignment; any assignment turned in more than 48 hours late will receive zero credit. 

## Honor Code

The purpose of homeworks is to help you get a deeper understanding of the course material and practice with applying the concepts learned in class, not just give us the right answers. You are encouraged to use online resources for learning more about the material covered in class; however, you should not look for or use found solutions to questions in the homeworks. This includes any solutions found on the internet to questions in the homework, solutions by a student in a previous class or by a current classmate, and/or by querying ChatGPT. Cheating will be punished according to university regulations as determined by the Office of Student Conduct and the University.
