## Course Overview

This advanced graduate-level course will focus on the latest theoretical and empirical developments in modern machine learning, with a primary focus on deep learning. We will explore cutting-edge machine learning methods such as transformers, diffusion models, self-supervised learning, and more, with an emphasis on the conceptual basis behind their design, success, and limitations. In addition to evaluating in-distribution performance, we will also assess out-of-distribution performance, robustness, emergent behavior, and optimization challenges and mysteries of these models. We will cover classical theoretical results in statistical machine learning and optimization, and explore their connections (or lack thereof) to recent empirical and theoretical research findings.

## Prerequisites
There are no official prerequisites however students are expected to have mathematical maturity and proficiency in probability, linear algebra, statistics, and fundamental machine learning concepts. Familiarity with the topics covered in CIS 5200 is recommended, but not required. While the course will primarily focus on concepts and theory, some small-scale empirical explorations may be expected, requiring a basic understanding of Python or the ability to learn it through self-study. 

The following books are useful for background reading.

## Class Format

This course will feature a combination of lectures, and student presentations, with a significant portion of class time dedicated to in-depth discussions of the presented material. There will also be a few guest lectures from leading researchers from industry and academia. The lectures will typically cover the core technical concepts. This will be followed by paper discussions involving role-playing inspired by [Alec Jacobson and Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html). We will be adopting a subset of the following roles:

- _Reviewer_: The paper has been submitted to NeurIPS, and you have been assigned to review it. Follow the [review form](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/ReviewerGuidelines) from NeurIPS as a guideline and submit a review for this paper. 
- _Archaeologist_: Youâ€™re an archeologist who must determine where this paper sits in the context of previous work. You must find and report on atleast one _older_ paper cited within the current paper that substantially influenced the current paper and atleast one _newer_ paper that cites this current paper. Look out for follow-up work that offers criticism of the current paper.
- _Student Researcher_: You are looking for a new research problem and the paper piqued your interest. You have to come up with follow-up project ideas based on the paper. These can be direct improvements of the paper, or projects that use the papers results as building blocks.
- _Reproducibility Checker_: You want to check whether the claims of the paper are valid. You decide to create a small experiment (toy dataset, or toy model) and verify if the results hold. Make sure to check how robust they are to various choice of hyperparameters.
- _Quanta Correspondent_: You want to write an article on the paper for Qanta. You must explain to a broad audience the main problem the paper is addressing, why it is impotant, and what the main technical contributions are.

Paper readings will be posted a week prior to the lecture. You will be able to access them from the schedule, at least one week prior to the class. The readings marked as _discussion_ will be presented in the above-mentioned role-play style. A sign-up sheet will be provided for discussion roles for each such reading - five students will take a subset of the above mentioned role. This role defines the lens through which you must read the paper and what you should prepare for the in-class discussion. Each student will be expected to take the 'Reviewer' role for two readings. Along with the review, the 'Reviewer' role also requires the student to present the paper to the class. For those, who are not assigned a role, you will be required to submit at least one question (_clarification or discussion point_) prior to the lecture. This will count towards your class participation grade.

## Course Project

The project can either be a literature survey or include original research:

- **Literature survey**: You can pick any topic covered in the class or in the broader area of modern machine learning for your literature survey. Your survey must include in-depth summaries and exposition of relevant papers on the chosen topic, comparing and contrasting them.

- **Original research**: It can be either theoretical or empirical (or a mix of the two). Make sure to get it approved by me. If you choose this option, you can do it either individually or in groups of 2. You are encouraged to use your current research in the project. The best outcome of this type of project is a manuscript that is publishable at a major machine learning conference (COLT, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR etc.) or journal (TMLR, JMLR).

Here is the tentative timeline for the course project:

- Project proposal (due on Oct 10 2022): A short document with at most 2 pages of content (plus references) (1) _survey_: stating the list of papers you plan to survey, and the reasons behind your choice (why you think it is important or interesting), (2) _original research_: describing the proposed problem, why it is interesting, and a brief list of references to prior work. Please be mindful of not being overly ambitious, and scoping the projects appropriately.

- Midway progress report (due on Nov 15 2023): A document with roughly 3-4 pages of content (plus references) highlighting the progress you have made so far, and your plan for the remaining of the semester. Compared to the proposal, this should be more concrete and detailed, with preliminary results that you may have.

- Final project presentations will be held in class on Dec 5 & 7 2023. Format will be decided based on the number of groups.

- Final project reports (due on Dec 15 2023): This should be in the style of a NeurIPS paper. You are allowed up to 6 pages (you do not need to use all 6) of content with unlimited appendices. 

## Grading

Your grade will be based on three components: **Discussions/Class Participation 25%; Final Project 45%**. There will be no homeworks or exams.

- **Discussions (55%)**
  - There will be 20 paper readings in total scattered in between lectures
  - You will take roles in five out of the 20 paper readings
  - You will need to play reviewer for two papers for 30% of the grade
    - This entails presenting the paper jointly with the other reviewer (5%)
    - Presenting your critique (5%)
    - Submitting your written review (5%)
    - May require a bit of 'deep dig' but not expected to read appendices unless you want to
  - The other roles only require you presenting for 3 mins and you will need to do this for three papers for 15% of the grade
    - At the level of 'start to dig'
  - If you are not presenting, then your participation in the discussion and questions count for the rest of the 10% participation grade (will adjust to count for participation in at least 10 out of 15 remaining papers)
    - Only 'surface level' reading required
  - (_extra credit_) The reproducibility role be for one paper for 10% bonus grade

- **Project (45%)**
  - 10% for 1-2 page proposal
  - 10% for 3-4 page progress report 
  - 15% for 4-6 page final report (with unlimited appendix) 
  - 10% for <=10 minute presentation 

## Resources 

We will be reading several seminal works in machine learning as well as very recent works that have not yet been peer-reviewed. Therefore, learning how to effectively read, review, and present research papers will be an important skill for the class. [Learning Theory Alliance](www.let-all.com) has some very helpful resources on tips for effectively reading papers ([read1](https://let-all.com/assets/slides/How-to-ALT22-Aaditya.pdf) and [read2](https://let-all.com/assets/slides/How-to-ALT22-Sam.pdf)) and reviewing ([review1](https://let-all.com/assets/slides/How-to-ALT22-Csaba.pdf)) that I encourage you to check out. The first lecture will cover some of this material.
